# Warnings that may require field check

These warnings report results that are not expected, but do not necessarily indicate an error. A field check is only necessary if something seems wrong.

**DBH_dead_suspicious**: These are trees with DBH >2cm different from previous census measurement. These are possible if the tree grew fairly rapidly between the last measurement and the time it died or if decomposition (e.g., bark loss) has alredy reduced the DBH. Some measurement error is also normal, and could contribute. Records should be reviewed, but a field check is only needed if a record is way off (e.g., potential units problem). 

**Dead_but_now_alive**: Sometimes trees appear dead in one census but come back to life the next. If there arae a lot of these, that may indicate a problem.
