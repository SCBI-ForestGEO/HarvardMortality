# Data tests for mortality census

All files of form `test-***.R` are run as tests. For example, the script `test-if-required-field-fixR.R` checks if a field fix error .csv exists in the repository, indicating there are unresolved field fix errors. If so, an alert notification is issued to the user. 

## Table of tests 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kable(read_csv(here("testthat/table_of_tests.csv")))
