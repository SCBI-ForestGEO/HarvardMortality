[Temperate Forest Tree Mortality Protocol_2021.docx](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBImortality/blob/main/Protocols/Reference/Temperate%20Forest%20Tree%20Mortality%20Protocol_2021.docx) is the protocol applied across temperate ForestGEO plots under our NSF macrosystems grant (2021-). 
The SCBI protocol includes all of this, along with some legacy measurements from our prior census (started prior) and add-ons to capture the dynamics of the emerald ash borer infestation.
