- Script to produce all future mortality scripts was created
- Can be found in github repo: SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree_mortality/R_script/Script_to_produce_all_mort_surveys

Formatting of the script:
- Step-by-side descriptions are included in the script
- Data from 2018 five-year census was taken and integrated with most recent mortality survey (2018)
- Subsetted out only 'census 3' (2018) information to have as reference
	- note that previous mortality surveys had DBHs that were taken from 2013 five-year census data
- Fraxinus >= 1cm added
- New status (2019) column added and old status column (2015) removed
- Trees marked DS, DC, or PD from 2018 marked as PD in 2019 column
- 2018 comment column renamed "old comments"
- New column made for 2019 comments for the purpose of keeping old comments like "tag lost" or "being crushed"
	- R makes columns be named 'X2019...' - will not let columns start with numbers
- Previous crown positions, factors of death (FAD), Fraxinus diagnoses, and other erroneous data entries from previous years cleared
- Added date and surveyer columns
